# Diction

A JavaScript code for sorting words based on a given array.  

First, we create an array with the words we would like to include, in aphabetical order, and then we provide a word for which we are going to search and find it's correct posistion inside the array.

From the first point of view, it looks like this code is somehow peculliar, as it doesn't solve any problem and neither it seems to provide something useful for the user.

On the other hand, the usefulness of the code depends soleley on the array that the user will provide, should the user wishes to do something like this.

Detailed explanations can be found in the comments inside the code, and so, the user can use this info to adapt the code to his or her own needs and thus, to create something useful based on that code.


## Instructions

The file `diction.js` is just a demonstration code and you will need to provide an array in order to be able to use it in a helpful manner.

Otherwise, you may download the code and run it in the console. This way, you can test the code with the included sample array, which contains just the Engish alphabet.
