# Diction

A JavaScript code for sorting words based on a given array.  

First, we create an array with the words we would like to include, in aphabetical order, and then we provide a word for which we are going to search and find it's correct posistion inside the array.

From the first point of view, it looks like this code is somehow peculiar as it doesn't solve any problem and neither it seems to provide something usefull for the user.

Nevertheless, the usefulness of the code depends soleley on the array that the user will provide, should they wish to do something like this.

Detailed explanations can be found in the comments inside the code and so, the user can use this info to adapt the code to his or her own needs and to create something really usefull based on that code.
